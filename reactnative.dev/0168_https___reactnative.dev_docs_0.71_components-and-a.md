React Native provides a number of built-in [Core Components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/intro-react-native-components) ready for you to use in your app. You can find them all in the left sidebar (or menu above, if you are on a narrow screen). If you're not sure where to get started, take a look at the following categories:


You're not limited to the components and APIs bundled with React Native. React Native has a community of thousands of developers. If you're looking for a library that does something specific, please refer to [this guide about finding libraries](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/libraries#finding-libraries).
## Basic Components[​](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/components-and-apis#basic-components "Direct link to Basic Components")
Most apps will end up using one of these basic components.
### [ViewThe most fundamental component for building a UI.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/view)
### [TextA component for displaying text.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/text)
### [ImageA component for displaying images.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/image)
### [TextInputA component for inputting text into the app via a keyboard.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/textinput)
### [ScrollViewProvides a scrolling container that can host multiple components and views.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/scrollview)
### [StyleSheetProvides an abstraction layer similar to CSS stylesheets.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/stylesheet)
## User Interface[​](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/components-and-apis#user-interface "Direct link to User Interface")
These common user interface controls will render on any platform.
### [ButtonA basic button component for handling touches that should render nicely on any platform.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/button)
### [SwitchRenders a boolean input.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/switch)
## List Views[​](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/components-and-apis#list-views "Direct link to List Views")
Unlike the more generic [`ScrollView`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/scrollview), the following list view components only render elements that are currently showing on the screen. This makes them a performant choice for displaying long lists of data.
### [FlatListA component for rendering performant scrollable lists.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/flatlist)
### [SectionListLike `FlatList`, but for sectioned lists.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/sectionlist)
## Android Components and APIs[​](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/components-and-apis#android-components-and-apis "Direct link to Android Components and APIs")
Many of the following components provide wrappers for commonly used Android classes.
### [BackHandlerDetect hardware button presses for back navigation.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/backhandler)
### [DrawerLayoutAndroidRenders a `DrawerLayout` on Android.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/drawerlayoutandroid)
### [PermissionsAndroidProvides access to the permissions model introduced in Android M.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/permissionsandroid)
### [ToastAndroidCreate an Android Toast alert.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/toastandroid)
## iOS Components and APIs[​](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/components-and-apis#ios-components-and-apis "Direct link to iOS Components and APIs")
Many of the following components provide wrappers for commonly used UIKit classes.
### [ActionSheetIOSAPI to display an iOS action sheet or share sheet.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/actionsheetios)
## Others[​](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/components-and-apis#others "Direct link to Others")
These components may be useful for certain applications. For an exhaustive list of components and APIs, check out the sidebar to the left (or menu above, if you are on a narrow screen).
