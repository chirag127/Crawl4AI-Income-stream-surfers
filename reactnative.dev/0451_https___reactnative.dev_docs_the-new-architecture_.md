This document contains a set of advanced topics to implement more complex functionalities of Native Components. It is recommended to first read the [Codegen](https://reactnative.dev/docs/the-new-architecture/what-is-codegen) section and the guides on [Native Components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fabric-native-components-introduction).
This guide will cover the following topics:
  * [Measuring the Layout](https://reactnative.dev/docs/the-new-architecture/layout-measurements)
  * [Invoking native functions on your native component](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/the-new-architecture/fabric-component-native-commands)
