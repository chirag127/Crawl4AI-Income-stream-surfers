# React Native versions
Open source React Native releases follow a monthly release train that is coordinated on GitHub through the[`react-native-releases`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases) repository. At the beginning of each month, a new release candidate is created off the master branch of [`facebook/react-native`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). The release candidate will soak for a month to allow contributors like yourself to [verify the changes](https://archive.reactnative.dev/docs/upgrading) and to identify any issues by [writing clear, actionable bug reports](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues). Eventually, the release candidate will be promoted to stable.
## Stable versions
The most recent stable version will be used automatically whenever a new project is created using the `react-native init` command.
