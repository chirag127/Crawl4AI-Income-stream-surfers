### Discussions and efforts[​](https://reactnative.dev/community/staying-updated#discussions-and-efforts "Direct link to Discussions and efforts")
React Native is a dynamic framework and there is always room for improvement. As an open source framework, large-scale coordination and discussion should remain publicly accessible. Here are some dedicated discussion groups you can participate in:
