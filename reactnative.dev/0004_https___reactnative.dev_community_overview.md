Join us for React Conf on Oct 7-8. [Learn more](https://conf.react.dev).
React Native is a widely used technology, empowered by a massive community of [hundreds of thousands of developers](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/stargazers) and downloaded [over 2 million times](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native) every week.
In this section you will find listed ways you can also be part of the React Native-related communities, depending on your wants and needs:
  * [Staying up to date](https://reactnative.dev/community/staying-updated)
  * [Participating in the community](https://reactnative.dev/community/communities)
  * [Needing and providing help](https://reactnative.dev/community/support)


We expect all folks participating in React Native' communities to adhere to the guidelines within our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
