This is unreleased documentation for React Native **Next** version.
For up-to-date documentation, see the **[latest version](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-platform)** (0.79).
Version: Next
Your application may need access to platform features that arenâ€™t directly available from react-native or one of the hundreds of [third-party libraries](https://reactnative.directory/) maintained by the community. Maybe you want to reuse some existing Objective-C, Swift, Java, Kotlin or C++ code from the JavaScript runtime. Whatever your reason, React Native exposes a powerful set of API to connect your native code to your JavaScript application code.
This guide introduces:
  * **Native Modules:** native libraries that have no User Interface (UI) for the user. Examples would be persistent storage, notifications, network events. These are accessible to your user as JavaScript functions and objects.
  * **Native Component:** native platform views, widgets and controllers that are available to your application's JavaScript code through React Components.


note
You might have previously been familiar with:
  * [Legacy Native Modules](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/legacy/native-modules-intro);
  * [Legacy Native Components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/legacy/native-components-android);


These are our deprecated native module and component API. You can still use many of these legacy libraries with the New Architecture thanks to our interop layers. You should consider:
  * using alternative libraries,
  * upgrading to newer library versions that have first-class support for the New Architecture, or
  * port these libraries yourself to Turbo Native Modules or Fabric Native Components.
