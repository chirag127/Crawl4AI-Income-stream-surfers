Join us for React Conf on Oct 7-8. [Learn more](https://conf.react.dev).
Last week at Chain React we announced Hermes, an open source JavaScript engine we’ve been working on at Facebook. It’s a small and lightweight JavaScript engine optimized for running React Native on Android. [Check it out!](https://code.fb.com/android/hermes/)
Hermes improves React Native performance by decreasing memory utilization, reducing download size, and decreasing the time it takes for the app to become usable or “time to interactive” (TTI).
> “As we analyzed performance data, we noticed that the JavaScript engine itself was a significant factor in startup performance and download size. With this data in hand, we knew we had to optimize JavaScript performance in the more constrained environments of a mobile phone compared with a desktop or laptop. After exploring other options, we built a new JavaScript engine we call Hermes. It is designed to improve app performance, focusing on our React Native apps, even on mass-market devices with limited memory, slow storage, and reduced computing power.” —[Hermes: An open source JavaScript engine optimized for mobile apps, starting with React Native](https://code.fb.com/android/hermes/)
Want to get started right away? Be sure to [check out our new guide to enabling Hermes in your existing React Native app](https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes) in the docs!
