Join us for React Conf on Oct 7-8. [Learn more](https://conf.react.dev).
[`TextInput`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput#content) is a [Core Component](https://reactnative.dev/docs/intro-react-native-components) that allows the user to enter text. It has an `onChangeText` prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an `onSubmitEditing` prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï üçï".
In this example, we store `text` in the state, because it changes over time.
There are a lot more things you might want to do with a text input. For example, you could validate the text inside while the user types. For more detailed examples, see the [React docs on controlled components](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable), or the [reference docs for TextInput](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput).
Text input is one of the ways the user interacts with the app. Next, let's look at another type of input and [learn how to handle touches](https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches).
