Last updated: **2025-03-27**
The Model Context Protocol is rapidly evolving. This page outlines our current thinking on key priorities and direction for approximately **the next six months** , though these may change significantly as the project develops. To see what’s changed recently, check out the **[specification changelog](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/changelog)**.
The ideas presented here are not commitments—we may solve these challenges differently than described, or some may not materialize at all. This is also not an _exhaustive_ list; we may incorporate work that isn’t mentioned here.
We value community participation! Each section links to relevant discussions where you can learn more and contribute your thoughts.
For a technical view of our standardization process, visit the [Standards Track](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/projects/2/views/2) on GitHub, which tracks how proposals progress toward inclusion in the official [MCP specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io).
## Validation
To foster a robust developer ecosystem, we plan to invest in:
  * **Reference Client Implementations** : demonstrating protocol features with high-quality AI applications
  * **Compliance Test Suites** : automated verification that clients, servers, and SDKs properly implement the specification


These tools will help developers confidently implement MCP while ensuring consistent behavior across the ecosystem.
## Registry
For MCP to reach its full potential, we need streamlined ways to distribute and discover MCP servers.
We plan to develop an [**MCP Registry**](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/159) that will enable centralized server discovery and metadata. This registry will primarily function as an API layer that third-party marketplaces and discovery services can build upon.
## Agents
As MCP increasingly becomes part of agentic workflows, we’re exploring [improvements](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/discussions/111) such as:
  * : enabling complex agent topologies through namespacing and graph-aware communication patterns
  * **Interactive Workflows** : improving human-in-the-loop experiences with granular permissioning, standardized interaction patterns, and [ways to directly communicate](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/issues/97) with the end user


## Multimodality
Supporting the full spectrum of AI capabilities in MCP, including:
  * **Additional Modalities** : video and other media types
  * : multipart, chunked messages, and bidirectional communication for interactive experiences


## Governance
We’re implementing governance structures that prioritize:
  * **Community-Led Development** : fostering a collaborative ecosystem where community members and AI developers can all participate in MCP’s evolution, ensuring it serves diverse applications and use cases
  * **Transparent Standardization** : establishing clear processes for contributing to the specification, while exploring formal standardization via industry bodies


## Get Involved
We welcome your contributions to MCP’s future! Join our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/discussions) to share ideas, provide feedback, or participate in the development process.
