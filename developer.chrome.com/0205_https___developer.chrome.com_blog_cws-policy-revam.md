#  Chrome Web Store Policy Updates

Rebecca Soares 
We are announcing a set of policy updates designed to encourage the development of high quality products, prevent deceptive behavior, and ensure informed user consent. These updates include:
  1. [Minimum Functionality Policy Update](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/minimum-functionality) —Expands our current Minimum Functionality Policy to include click-baity template extensions, empty extensions, and extensions that do not directly provide their stated functionality.
  2. [Misleading and Deceptive Behavior Policy Update](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/unexpected-behavior) —Prohibits anti-virus, privacy, and security extensions that provide no discernible protection or monitoring.
  3. [Affiliate Ads Policy](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/affiliate-ads) —Establishes new disclosure requirements for extensions that include affiliate ad programs. Developers will now be required to disclose any affiliate programs to users before installation. Additionally, related user action is required before the inclusion of affiliate codes, links, or cookies.


Developers can also learn more about today's guidance in our Program Policies. These policy clarifications will go into effect on January 15, 2023. After that date, extensions in violation of these new policies may be removed from the Chrome Web Store and be disabled.
If you have any questions, you can contact developer support.
Thank you for your cooperation, and for your participation in the Chrome extension ecosystem!
