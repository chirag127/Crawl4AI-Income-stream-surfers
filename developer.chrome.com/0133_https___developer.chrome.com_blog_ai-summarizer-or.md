Support your users in making sense of long texts, faster. Starting in Chrome 131, you can [sign up](https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials#/view_trial/1923599990840623105) for the Summarizer API origin trial that runs until Chrome 136. Learn more about how to [use the Summarizer API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/summarizer-api).
If you're new to [origin trials](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/origin-trials), these are time-limited programs that offer early access to experimental platform features. While there may be usage limits, developers can integrate these features for live testing, gathering user feedback, with the goal of informing future iterations of the API.
We are seeking to standardize this API for broad availability. Read about the standardization effort with the [W3C Technical Architecture Group](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/991).
## Use cases
The Summarizer API can be used to generate summaries in varied lengths and formats, such as sentences, paragraphs, bullet point lists, and more. You could use this API to:
  * Summarize the key points of an article or a chat conversation.
  * Suggest titles and headings for articles.
  * Create a concise and informative summary of a lengthy text.
  * Generate a teaser for a book based on a book review.


## Share your feedback
You can follow the status of the Summarizer API on [Chrome Status](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5193953788559360). We look forward to hearing your feedback.
  * For feedback on Chrome's implementation, file a [Chromium bug](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/new?component=1617227&priority=P2&type=bug&template=0&noWizard=true).
  * Share your feedback on the API shape of the Summarization API by commenting on an existing issue or by opening a new one in the [Writing Assistance API GitHub repository](https://github.com/WICG/writing-assistance-apis/issues).
