Published: March 11, 2025 
As part of our ongoing efforts to improve the extension ecosystem, we are updating our [Affiliate Ads Policy](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/affiliate-ads) to further clarify how affiliate links, codes, and cookies can be used in Chrome extensions.
## What's changing?
The updated policy ensures that **affiliate links are only included when they provide a direct and transparent benefit to users.** This means that extensions cannot inject affiliate links when no actual value—such as a discount, cashback, or relevant offer—is being provided.
Under this policy, an extension **must not add, modify, or replace affiliate links** unless:
  * The affiliate program is **clearly disclosed** on the Chrome Web Store listing, in the user interface, and before installation.
  * **User action is required** before any affiliate link, code, or cookie is applied.
  * The affiliate link is tied to a **direct benefit** for the user at that moment.


For example, an extension that finds and applies coupon codes must not insert an affiliate link if no coupon or discount is found. This prevents extensions from intervening in a user's browser experience without delivering a clear value in return.
## Why this matters
This update helps maintain a healthy web ecosystem by ensuring that affiliate monetization is aligned with user benefit. Users should always be in control of their browsing experience and understand how extensions interact with the websites they visit. By enforcing these requirements, we aim to protect users from deceptive practices while allowing high-quality, value-driven extensions to thrive.
## What these updates mean for developers
Developers should review their extensions to ensure compliance with the updated policy. If your extension uses affiliate links, make sure they are only applied when they directly benefit users and that all required disclosures are in place.
We encourage developers to update their extensions as soon as possible. Enforcement of the new policy will begin June 10th 2025, and extensions found in violation may be subject to removal from the Chrome Web Store.
