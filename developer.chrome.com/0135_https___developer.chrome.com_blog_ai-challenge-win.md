Published: January 13, 2025 
Last October, we launched the [Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge](https://goo.gle/ChromeAIChallenge), where we invited you to develop a web application or Chrome Extension that used one or more Chrome built-in AI APIs with Gemini Nano. Thank you to the over 8,600 people who participated and created more than 650 complete submissions.
From all of these submissions, we narrowed down our winners based on five criteria, including functionality, purpose, content, user experience, and technical execution.
Thank you to everyone who participated. Our judges were excited by all of the [wonderful submissions](https://googlechromeai.devpost.com/project-gallery). With that, congratulations to all the winners!
## Best real-world app
The best 'real-world' application effectively addresses a significant need or problem. The winning applications combine practicality, usability, and technological excellence to deliver meaningful value to its users.
### Web application winner: WP on-device AI assistant
[WP on-device AI assistant](https://devpost.com/software/wp-on-device-ai-assistant) is a WordPress plugin that provides an on-device AI assistant for your website. It exposes three main features: the AI assistant block, the paragraph rewriter, and the title generator.
### Chrome Extension winner: Mochi
[Mochi - making hard content enjoyable](https://devpost.com/software/mochi-6i7vuk) is a Chrome Extension that adapts web content for users with reading disabilities, ADHD, and dyslexia. Like its namesake, it makes hard-to-read content softer and more digestible.
## Most innovative app
The most innovative application pushes the boundaries by redefining the expectations of what we think is possible. These applications spark excitement and help set the stage for the next wave of technological advancement.
### Web application winner: The Crooked Tankard
[The Crooked Tankard](https://devpost.com/software/the-crooked-tankard) is a text-based adventure game, in which the game responds to your actions with a simulated outcome. This simulation, and the capabilities of the game logic are fixed. Some situations controlled by RNG and others involve AI in the decision making process. AI is used to populate the pre-generated game world with concrete names and descriptions, and to narrate the events that occur in each round.
### Chrome Extension winner: Opale
[Opale](https://devpost.com/software/opale) helps you rewrite, translate, and template your way to workflow mastery—create custom AI prompts once, then reuse them across any task without jumping between different tools.
## Best hybrid AI app
A hybrid AI app works with client-side and server-side AI. These hybrid AI apps provide seamless experiences for users, by getting benefits from both client and server inference.
### Chrome Extension winner: Orma
[Orma](https://devpost.com/software/orma) is your browser's memory layer that transforms how you learn online. Instantly capture, understand, and chat with your browsing history using AI, making digital knowledge truly personal.
