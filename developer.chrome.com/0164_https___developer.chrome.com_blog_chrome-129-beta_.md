Unless otherwise noted, the following changes apply to the newest Chrome beta channel release for Android, ChromeOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows. Learn more about the features listed here through the provided links or from the list on ChromeStatus.com. Chrome 129 is beta as of August 21, 2024. You can download the latest on [Google.com](https://www.google.com/chrome/beta/) for desktop or on Google Play Store on Android.
## CSS
This release adds two new CSS features, and updates three features.
### CSS `interpolate-size property` and `calc-size()` function
The CSS `interpolate-size` property lets a page opt into animations and transitions of CSS intrinsic sizing keywords such as `auto`, `min-content`, and `fit-content`, in the cases where those keywords can be animated.
The CSS `calc-size()` function is a CSS function similar to `calc()`, however it also supports operations on exactly one supported sizing keyword. Currently supported sizing keywords are `auto`, `min-content`, `max-content`, and `fit-content`. Other sizing keywords that may be supported in the future include `stretch` (currently supported as prefixed `-webkit-fill-available`) and `contain`. This function is used to represent the values in the middle of the animations allowed by the `interpolate-size` property.
### Rename CSS anchor positioning `inset-area` to `position-area`
The [CSSWG resolved to rename this property](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10209#issuecomment-2221005001) from `inset-area` to `position-area`. Chrome 129 ships `position-area`, the `inset-area` name will be removed in a future release.
### CSS Anchor Positioning: Unwrapped `inset-area()`
Replaces the `inset-area()` function with inset-area values directly within `position-try-fallbacks`. For example instead of `position-try-fallbacks:inset-area(top)` use `position-try-fallbacks:top`.
### Update CSS backdrop-filter to use mirror edgeMode
The `backdrop-filter` CSS property applies one or more filters to the _backdrop_ of an element. The backdrop is the painted content that lies behind the element. A common filter is a blur allowing designers to construct "frosted glass" dialog boxes, video overlays, translucent navigation headers, and more.
This was initially implemented the same way as a regular blur, but sampling beyond the edges of the element allowed colors from the edges to bleed in. The spec was changed to sample pixels outside the backdrop edges by duplicating the pixels at the edge. This however, results in extreme flickering of content as it enters the backdrop edge. The latest specification change mirrors the backdrop when sampling beyond the edge which allows for a smooth gradual introduction of new colors at the edges without overweighting on single lines of color.
## Web APIs
### Blob support in WebRTC data channels
Implements `RTCDataChannel.send(Blob)`, and the `onMessage` event can now optionally receive data of type `Blob` using the `binaryType` attribute.
In addition to supporting sending strings and ArrayBuffers, you can now choose to send a `Blob` instead as long as its size is below the SCTP transport `maxMessageSize` as indicated in the [WebRTC specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/#dom-rtcsctptransport-maxmessagesize).
With the `binaryType` attribute set to `"blob"`, the onMessage event data attribute will be of type `Blob` instead of the currently supported `ArrayBuffer`.
### Compute Pressure WebDriver extension commands
Exposes WebDriver commands for creating, removing and updating pressure source samples for _virtual pressure sources_. Such pressure sources that don't depend on underlying hardware or operating system support and can be used for testing.
### `Intl.DurationFormat`
Provides a method of formatting durations, for example "1 hr 40 min 30 sec" that supports multiple locales.
### Private Aggregation API: client-side contribution merging
Modifies the Private Aggregation API to merge histogram contributions with the same bucket and filtering ID before embedding in the aggregatable report's encrypted payload.
Private Aggregation imposes a limit on the number of contributions that can be embedded in a single aggregatable report, with any additional contributions being dropped. By merging together contributions where possible, we can get additional utility out of the limit. Note that, ignoring the dropping of excess contributions, merging these sorts of contributions shouldn't have any impact on the final outputs, for example summary reports.
### `scheduler.yield()`
Provides a method for yielding control to the browser, which can be used to break up long tasks. Awaiting the promise returned by `scheduler.yield()` causes the current task to yield, continuing in a new browser task. This can be used to improve responsiveness issues caused by long tasks. Continuations are prioritized to mitigate performance problems of existing alternatives.
### Web Authentication API: JSON serialization methods
The WebAuthn `PublicKeyCredential.toJSON()`, `parseCreationOptionsFromJSON()`, and `parseRequestOptionsFromJSON()` methods let developers serialize a WebAuthn response into a JSON object or deserialize a WebAuthn request object from its JSON representation.
### WebGPU extended range (HDR) support
Adds tone mapping parameters to the WebGPU canvas configuration, and adds options of `standard` (the current behavior of restricting content to the SDR range of the display) as the default, and `extended` (not imposing this restriction) as a new behavior. This allows WebGPU content to use the full range of a display.
## Origin trials in progress
In Chrome 129 you can opt into the following new [origin trials](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/origin-trials).
### FileSystemObserver interface
The [FileSystemObserver](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/file-system-observer) interface notifies websites of changes to the file system. Sites observe changes to files and directories in the user's local device (as specified in [WICG/file-system-access](https://github.com/WICG/file-system-access)) or in the Bucket File System (as specified in [fs.spec.whatwg.org](https://fs.spec.whatwg.org/)), and are notified of basic change info, such as the change type.
[Register for the FileSystemObserver origin trial](https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials#/register_trial/59109745109237761).
## Deprecations and removals
This version of Chrome introduces the deprecations and removals listed below. Visit [ChromeStatus.com](https://chromestatus.com) for lists of planned deprecations, current deprecations and previous removals.
This release of Chrome deprecates one feature.
### Deprecate `0.0.0.0` for Private Network Access
Chrome will block access to IP address `0.0.0.0` in advance of Private Network Access (PNA) completely rolling out.
Chrome is deprecating direct access to private network endpoints from public websites as part of the [PNA specification](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/private-network-access-preflight). Services listening on localhost (`127.0.0.0/8`) are considered private according to the specification. Chrome's PNA protection can be bypassed using the IP address `0.0.0.0` to access services listening on the localhost on macOS and Linux.
This can also be abused in DNS rebinding attacks targeting a web application listening on the localhost.
This release of Chrome removes three features.
### Remove the `includeShadowRoots` argument on DOMParser
The `includeShadowRoots` argument was a never-standardized argument to the `DOMParser.parseFromString()` function, which was there to allow imperative parsing of HTML content that contains declarative shadow DOM. This was shipped in Chrome 90 as part of the initial shipment of declarative shadow DOM.
Now that a standardized version of this feature is available with the `setHTMLUnsafe()` and `parseHTMLUnsafe()` methods, the non-standard `includeShadowRoots` argument will be removed. Code should be updated as follows:
Instead of:
```
((newDOMParser()).parseFromString(html,'text/html',{includeShadowRoots:true});

```

Use:
```
Document.parseHTMLUnsafe(html);

```

### Remove non-standard declarative shadow DOM serialization
The prototype implementation of declarative shadow DOM contained a method called `getInnerHTML()` used to serialize DOM trees containing shadow roots. That part of the prototype was not standardized with the rest of declarative shadow dom, and instead a replacement was designed—`getHTML()`.
Therefore the old `getInnerHTML()` method is now being removed from Chrome, you should use [`getHTML()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/getHTML) as a replacement, which will soon be interoperable across browsers.
### Remove `PointerEvent.getCoalescedEvents()` from insecure contexts
The Pointer Events Working Group made `PointerEvent.getCoalescedEvents()` restricted to secure contexts over four years ago, which removed the API from insecure contexts. Chrome originally shipped the old behavior and didn't follow the spec change immediately because of compat concerns.
We are now removing it from insecure contexts because Chrome usage in insecure contexts turned out to be very low.
