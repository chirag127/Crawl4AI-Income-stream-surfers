#  Overview of CrUX 
bookmark_borderbookmark Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Chrome User Experience Report (also known as the Chrome UX Report, or CrUX for short) is a dataset that reflects how real-world Chrome users experience popular destinations on the web.
CrUX is the official dataset of the [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/articles/vitals) program. All user-centric Core Web Vitals metrics are represented.
CrUX data is collected from real browsers around the world, based on certain browser options which determine [user eligibility](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/methodology#user-eligibility). A set of [dimensions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/methodology/dimensions) and [metrics](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/methodology/metrics) are collected which allow site owners to determine how users experience their sites.
The data collected by CrUX is available publicly through a number of [Google tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/methodology/tools) and third-party tools and is used by Google Search to inform the [page experience ranking factor](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/experience/page-experience).
Not all origins or pages are represented in the dataset. There are separate eligibility criteria for [origins](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/methodology#origin-eligibility) and [pages](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/methodology#page-eligibility), primarily that they must be publicly discoverable and there must be a large enough number of visitors in order to create a statistically significant dataset.
