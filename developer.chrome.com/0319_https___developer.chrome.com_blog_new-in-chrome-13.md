Here's what you need to know:
  * [More CSS styling](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-chrome-131?hl=en#styling-details) for the `<details>` element.
  * Easier print layout with [page margin boxes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-chrome-131?hl=en#page).
  * And there's plenty [more](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-chrome-131?hl=en#more).


I'm Mariko Kosaka. Let's dive in and see what's new for developers in Chrome 131.
## Styling Improvements to `<details>` and `<summary>`
You now have more options to style the structure of the `<details>` and `<summary>` elements in order to build disclosure or accordion widgets.
The changes introduced in this release enable the use of the `display` property, and add a `::details-content` pseudo-element to style the part that expands and collapses.
Historically it was impossible to change the display type of the `details` element. This restriction has now been relaxed, allowing you to use things like grid or flex layouts.
In this exclusive accordion example, made of several `details` elements, when one of the `details` elements is expanded, its content is placed next to the `summary`.
This is achieved by using a flex layout on the `details` element. You can also try more layout patterns with other display values such as `grid`.
Check out Bramus' article [More options for styling `<details>`](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/styling-details) for a more in-depth explanation.
## `@page` margin boxes
Support for page margin boxes, when printing a web document, or exporting it as PDF, has been added.
Page margin boxes let you define the contents in the margin area of a page. So, you can provide custom headers and footers rather than using the built-in headers and footers generated by the browser.
The page margin is defined using the `@page` rule in CSS.
```
@page:right{
@bottom-left{
content:"My book";
font-size:9pt;
color:#333;
}
}

```

The appearance and the contents of a margin box are specified with CSS properties inside the at-rules representing the 16 margin boxes using generated content.
For page numbering, counters are also supported with `page` for the current page number, and `pages` for the total number of pages.
Check out Rachel's article [Add content to the margins of web pages when printed using CSS ](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/print-margins) for a more in-depth explanation.
## And more!
And of course there is plenty more.
  * Support for external SVG resources for 'clip-path', 'fill', 'stroke' and 'marker'.
  * WebHID is enabled inside dedicated worker contexts.
  * Control the behavior of Emoji with the `font-variant-emoji` CSS property.
