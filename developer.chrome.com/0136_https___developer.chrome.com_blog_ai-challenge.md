Join us in exploring the potential of AI in Chrome! Today, we're launching the Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge, where we invite you to reimagine the web with built-in AI. Create innovative [web applications](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai) and [Chrome Extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/ai) using Chrome's integrated AI models and APIs, including Gemini Nano.
For this challenge, we invite you to create either a web application or Chrome Extension that uses one or more of the [Chrome built-in AI APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in-apis). These APIs let you access models like Gemini Nano for a variety of tasks. We may add new APIs to this list during the challenge, which we'll announce here, on the Chrome blog.
The current set of APIs includes:
  * Prompt API for the web
  * Prompt API for Chrome Extensions
  * [Language Detection API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/language-detection)
  * Translation API
  * Summarization API
  * Write API
  * Rewrite API


Explore the possibilities of [built-in AI](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in) and create experiences that meet everyday needs. From enriching user interaction to automating intricate processes, see how running AI tasks client-side can make for an easier deployment story, improve application responsiveness, extend AI features to persist in challenging conditions such as offline or end-to-end encrypted applications, and much more.
## Prizes
Winners are eligible for one of 16 prizes, ranging in value from $200 USD to $12,000 USD, totaling $65,000 USD. Winners also have a chance to connect with members of the built-in AI team.
You may even see your submission featured on one of our official Google channels.
## Sign up now
The challenge runs from now until 11:45 PM PST on December 3, 2024.
Sign up and get more information on the [Built-in AI Challenge website](https://goo.gle/ChromeAIChallenge). We can't wait to see what you create when you infuse the web with AI!
