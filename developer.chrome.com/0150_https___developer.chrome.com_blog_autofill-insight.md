Autofill in Chrome
Unlocking faster form filling and smoother checkout processes benefit both merchants and users.
**We've found that autofill users fill forms faster, with lower abandonment rates.**
The Chrome team analyzed thousands of address and credit card forms across millions of page loads on the most visited websites in Chrome in the United States. Our findings show that people who use autofill complete forms on average significantly faster, and are significantly less likely to abandon them.
While results vary by site, on the average form, our findings are as follows:
  * Compared to exclusively typing values in forms, **users abandon forms 75% less frequently when they use autofill**.
  * Compared to exclusively typing values in forms, **time spent filling forms is approximately 35% lower with autofill**.


The results in the overall analysis and specific verticals, like travel and retail websites, were similar.
In our study, "with autofill" or "autofill-assisted" means the user used autofill for some fields, but not necessarily for all fields. Partial autofill represents the majority of cases, and still correlates to significant reductions in both form abandonment rates and completion times.
Abandonment rates drop when autofill is used. Forms were analyzed across millions of page loads. The percentage displayed is the minimum drop we observed consistently across all website verticals (such as travel and retail). The median time to form completion drops when autofill is used. Forms were analyzed across millions of page loads. The percentage displayed is the minimum drop we were able to observe consistently across all website verticals (e.g. travel, retail). The timer starts the moment the user first interacts with the form to fill it, either by typing a character or using autofill.
## About the study
  * **This is a correlational study** , so keep in mind that the results may be skewed. Users who use autofill might already be faster at filling forms and less likely to abandon them. This could be because they are more comfortable with online forms or have greater digital literacy.
  * The study was run in the United States. Autofill success rates can vary significantly by region due to differences in website implementations, local address formats, and how Chrome's implementation caters to these formats.
  * This study is based on aggregated data from users with usage statistics enabled. Review details in [How Chrome protects user autofill data](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/14271924).
