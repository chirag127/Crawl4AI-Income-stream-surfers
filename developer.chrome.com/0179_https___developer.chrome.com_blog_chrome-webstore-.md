We're excited to announce a new feature for Chrome Web Store developers: the ability to cancel a review! You can now stop the review process for an item that's pending review.
The goal of this feature is to let you manage your extensions more easily and efficiently. When you identify errors in your pending review submission, you can now quickly cancel the review, make necessary changes, and resubmit the new item revision without unnecessary delays. We're really happy to finally launch this feature that many of you have requested.
## How to cancel a review?
To immediately cancel a pending review submission, open the **⋮ View more menu options** on the **Store listing** page, then click **Cancel review**. This lets you submit a new revision with a fix without waiting for the current submission with bugs to complete the review process.
Select "Cancel review" on the *Store listing* page to cancel a pending review. 
A confirmation dialog appears when you request to cancel a review. Click the **Cancel review** button to confirm. The submission will be canceled and returned to a draft state.
Confirm the cancellation by selecting "Cancel review" in the confirmation dialog. 
The cancel review feature is now live. For more information, refer to the [cancel review documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/cancel-review). The Chrome Web Store team is excited to continue enhancing the extension publishing and updating process for you.
