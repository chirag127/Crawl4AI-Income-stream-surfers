Watch the video to learn how to:
  * Inspect and clear caches with the **Network** panel.
  * Influence what Chrome caches with [`Cache-Control`](https://web.dev/articles/http-cache#flowchart).
  * Empty cache and hard reload.
  * Disable cache.
  * Filter resources cached by service workers.
  * Inspect and disable service worker cache with the **Application** panel.
  * Simulate devices with low storage.
