Published: September 24, 2024 
Last month, we shared that the Language Detection API was [available for early preview program participants](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/august2024-language-detection). Now, you can now sign up for the [Language Detection API origin trial](https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials#/view_trial/662592095176884225) that runs from Chrome 130 to 135.
This origin trial is part of Chrome's [built-in AI](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in) effort, which integrates AI models, including large language models (LLMs), in Chrome. The [Language Detection API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/language-detection) can determine the language of input text so that you can:
  * Translate content
  * Label the content language
  * Determine the correct model to load for language-specific tasks
  * Adjust your interface to reflect content in that Language


For those new to [origin trials](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/origin-trials), these are public and open to all developers. They are limited in duration and usage, and participation is a self-managed process with limited documentation and support. Origin trials offer an opportunity to build with experimental features, so your users can try them, before the feature is made available to everyone.
## Share your feedback
