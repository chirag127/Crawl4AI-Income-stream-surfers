Zach Warneke 
We're excited to launch a set of UI changes making the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard more responsive and mobile-friendly. We hope this gives you a more convenient and accessible experience when monitoring store listing performance, making listing changes, and managing extensions on the store.
## View store listing performance
All charts and analytics pages have been updated to be more responsive, so that you can better view your extensions' store listing performance on mobile devices.
## Update your store listing
You can also update your store metadata from a mobile device, including the description, images, and privacy settings.
## Manage your extensions
Additional management features can be used from a mobile device. For example, you can roll back an extension version quickly in an emergency. You can also update group publisher memberships and submit new item revisions, among other actions.
## Try it today
The new Developer Dashboard mobile experience is live starting today. Access it by visiting the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard from your mobile device.
