A language detection API is now available for local experimentation to our early preview program (EPP) participants. With this API, you can determine what language is being used on a web page.
The [language detection APIs explainer](https://github.com/WICG/translation-api?tab=readme-ov-file#language-detection) is available as a proposal for the future development of this [exploratory API](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/august2024-built-in-ai#what_are_we_building) and other APIs, including a translation API.
Language detection is the first step for translation. Browsers often already have language detection capabilities, and this API will allow web developers to access this technology with a JavaScript API.
As with our other APIs, we'll take your feedback to update the way language detection works, to ensure it meets the needs of developers and users. We hope to learn about the detection quality of summarization, feedback on the API design, and the impact of the current implementation in Chrome Canary.
## Demo
Once you've [signed up](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/august2024-language-detection?hl=en#join-the-epp) and been accepted to the EPP, you'll have access to a demo so you can experiment with this API.
## Join the early preview program
As of now, the Prompt API, summarization API, and the language detection API are [available for prototyping](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in-apis).
Sign up for the [early preview program](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/join-epp) to gain access to the documentation and demos, stay up-to-date with the latest changes, and discover new APIs.
