With the Translator API in Chrome, you can live-translate text in the browser, using local AI models. Your website may already offer website content in multiple languages, and now, users can contribute in their first language. Starting in Chrome 131, you can [sign up for the Translator API origin trial](https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials#/view_trial/4445615782168100865) that runs until Chrome 137.
Learn more about how to use the [Translator API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/translator-api).
This origin trial is part of Chrome's [built-in AI](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in) effort, which integrates AI models, including large language models (LLMs), in Chrome. The Translator API uses on-device language packs for client-side translation.
If you're new to [origin trials](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/origin-trials), these are time-limited programs that offer early access to experimental platform features. While there may be usage limits, developers can integrate these features for live testing, gathering user feedback, with the goal of informing future iterations of the API.
## Pair with the Language Detection API
In Chrome 130, we began the [Language Detection API origin trial](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/language-detection-origin-trial), so that you can detect the source language of a given text. Use this API to identify and share the source language with the Translator API, so you can translate it correctly.
## Share your feedback
We look forward to hearing your feedback. If you have feedback on Chrome's implementation, file a [Chromium bug](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/new?component=1583316&priority=P2&type=bug&template=0&noWizard=true).
You can share your feedback on the API shape of the Translator API by commenting on an existing issue or by opening a new one in the [Translator API repository](https://github.com/WICG/translation-api).
