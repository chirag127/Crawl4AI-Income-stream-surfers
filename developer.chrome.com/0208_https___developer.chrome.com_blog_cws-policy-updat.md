The Chrome Web Store is committed to fostering a high-quality and trustworthy ecosystem for developers and users. To align with this goal, we're announcing a series of policy updates designed to provide clarity and consistency across our platform. These updates address key areas of functionality, content standards, and developer guidance.
## 1. Appeals policy
We are streamlining our [appeals process](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/notification-and-appeals) to make it more efficient and transparent. Moving forward, developers will be allowed one appeal per policy violation. Once a verdict has been determined, developers won't be able to re-appeal.
## 2. Real money gambling policy
To align with broader Google product policies, we are updating [our language](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/regulated-goods-and-services) to explicitly disallow real money gambling on the Chrome Web Store. This clarification helps maintain a safe and compliant environment for users across all regions.
## 3. Quality guidelines FAQ update
To address common developer questions, we're updating our [Quality Guidelines FAQ](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/quality-guidelines-faq) to clarify key aspects of the Single Purpose Policy and how it relates to new tab pages. This includes a detailed explanation of vertical versus horizontal search, helping developers design their extensions to meet user needs while adhering to Chrome Web Store standards.
## What these updates mean for developers
We encourage all developers to review these updates and evaluate their extensions to ensure compliance with the new policies. By aligning with these guidelines, you can help create a safer, more innovative ecosystem for Chrome users worldwide. For more details on these updates and to access the revised policies, visit our Developer Policy Center. Let us know your thoughts on these changes, and as always, thank you for being part of the Chrome Web Store community!
