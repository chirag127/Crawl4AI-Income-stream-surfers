Published: August 16, 2024 
A summarization API is now available for local experimentation to our early preview program (EPP) participants. With this API, you use [built-in Gemini Nano](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in) to condense long-form content. Shorter content can be more accessible and useful to users for a number of [use cases](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/august2024-summarization-ai?hl=en#summarization-use-cases).
The initial version of this API is just the first step to accessing on-device summarization with Gemini Nano in Chrome.
The [writing assistance APIs explainer](https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/writing-assistance-apis/) is available as a proposal for the future development of this [exploratory API](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/august2024-built-in-ai#what_are_we_building) and other APIs, including a summarizer, writer, and re-writer. You can help this proposal move to the next stage by [indicating your support](https://github.com/WICG/proposals/issues/163) with a thumbs-up reaction or by commenting with details about your use cases and context.
We'll wield your feedback to shape the future of the API, to ensure it meets the needs of developers and users. We hope to learn about the quality of summarization, feedback on the API design, and the impact of the current implementation in Chrome Canary.
## Demo
Once you've [signed up](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/august2024-summarization-ai?hl=en#join-the-epp) and been accepted to the EPP, you can experiment with this API in our demo: [chrome.dev/web-ai-demos/summarization-api-playground/](https://chrome.dev/web-ai-demos/summarization-api-playground/)
## Summarization use cases
Thus far, we're aware of the following use cases for summarization:
  * Overview of a meeting transcript for those joining the meeting late or those who missed the meeting entirely.
  * Key points from support conversations for customer relationship management.
  * Sentence or paragraph-sized [summaries of multiple product reviews](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/evaluate-reviews).
  * Key points from long articles, to help readers determine if the article is relevant.
  * Generating draft titles for an article.
  * Summarizing questions in a forum to help experts find those which are most relevant to their field of expertise.

## Join the early preview program
As of now, the [Prompt API](https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/prompt-api/blob/main/README.md) and a summarization API are available for prototyping.
Sign up for the [early preview program](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/join-epp) to gain access to the documentation, stay up-to-date with the latest changes, and discover new APIs.
