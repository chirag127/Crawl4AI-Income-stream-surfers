Chrome DevTools lets you locally override and mock response headers, files, API requests, and more. Unblock your workflow by prototyping and testing changes and fixes without waiting for the backend, third-parties, or APIs to catch up.
Watch the video to learn how to use [local overrides](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overrides) to:
  * [Mock the responses of XHR or fetch requests](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overrides#override-xhr-fetch) to test production fixes before they actually go to production.
  * Prototype new UI designs.
  * Save overridden files to a folder to edit them with your favorite code editor and share them with your colleagues.
  * Test performance fixes to make sure in advance that they are significant.
  * [Override response headers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overrides#override-headers).
  * [Override headers for multiple URLs with wildcard characters](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overrides#edit-response-header-overrides).
  * [Filter overridden requests in the **Network** panel](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/reference#filter-by-property).
