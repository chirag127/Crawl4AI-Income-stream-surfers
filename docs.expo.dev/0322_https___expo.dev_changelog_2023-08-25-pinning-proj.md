# [Pinning Projects in Dashboard](https://expo.dev/changelog/2023-08-25-pinning-projects)

Do you love experimenting but want to have your main projects always at hand? Now you can pin them to the top of the list so they are always there when you need them!
To get started, visit your projects list, click on the three vertical dots icon and select "Pin project" option. You can also unpin the already pinned project via this actions menu.
