# [Audit logs available to enterprise users](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024-08-21-audit-logs-available)

As of recently, enterprise plan users can access audit logs through the Expo website. Audit logs are a chronological record of important actions taken by members of your organization. This includes things like permission grants, credential modifications, and actions taken on apps.
Audit logs have been enabled for several objects that will offer the highest level of action tracking. While we will be adding new ones to audit logs in the future, at the time of this blog post, we have enabled them for:
  * Accounts
  * Android app credentials
  * Android keystores
  * Apple devices
  * Apple distribution certificates
  * Apple provisioning profiles
  * Apple teams
  * App store connect API keys
  * Apps
  * Google service account keys
  * iOS app credentials
  * User invitations
  * User permissions


Audit logs are available on the enterprise plan and can be exported for 18 months.
### [Security activity is coming ](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024-08-21-audit-logs-available#security-activity-is-coming)
In the near future we will also roll out **security activity** , which will provide details about security-related activities in your user profile. We believe that security is a baseline of any good product and because of that security activity will be available for all users. Stay tuned for more information.
