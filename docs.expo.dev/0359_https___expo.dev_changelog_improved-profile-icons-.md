# [Improved project and account profile icons coming soon, will replace old icons](https://expo.dev/changelog/improved-profile-icons-soon)
Mar 9, 2025 by

You will soon be able to set an icon for your project and your account profile on the EAS website, and the legacy system is being phased out.
This is an advance announcement about project icons and account profile icons on the EAS website.
## [**Old project icons** ](https://expo.dev/changelog/improved-profile-icons-soon#old-project-icons)
The first change you may notice is that your project icons may have been replaced with a placeholder icon with your project name's initial letter:
The background behind this change is that older projects specified their icons using the Classic Updates service, which was [sunset](https://blog.expo.dev/sunsetting-expo-publish-and-classic-updates-6cb9cd295378) last February. Icons were part of these older updates, and they are removed with inactive updates when the updates expire.
For clarity, this change does not impact the home screen icons of any end user apps. It affects what developers see on the EAS website and we will be adding a new way to upload icons.
## [New icons for both projects and account profiles ](https://expo.dev/changelog/improved-profile-icons-soon#new-icons-for-both-projects-and-account-profiles)
Over the coming weeks, we will be adding options to upload project icons and account profile icons. You will be able to specify the icon you want to see for each project on the EAS website. In addition, you will also be able to specify the profile icon for your account, which we've been wanting to add for a long time.
Organization accounts will be able to have profile icons
We will share more when this feature is generally available.
