EAS Hosting is a service for quickly deploying your web projects built using [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) and React Native web. It seamlessly integrates with the Expo CLI, allowing you to automate the deployment of API routes, server functions, and server-side assets.
Hosting supports both [static](https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/static-rendering) and [server mode](https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/api-routes) web projects and offers the fastest path from `npx create-expo-app` to a fully deployed web app with API routes.
