# [Security activity record available to all users](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024-10-14-security-activity)

A new feature – the security activity record – is now available to all EAS users. It aims to give users insight into modification actions on their EAS user profile and helps them investigate any suspicious activity should it be necessary.
Users can use the security activity record to see a history of modifications their EAS user profile and the IP address of the device that made each change. It provides a detailed log of changes made to your user profile, which can be helpful when checking for unauthorized activity.
At the time of this blog post, the security activity record covers changes to:
  * Users, including enterprise SSO users
  * Passwords
  * Two-factor authentication
  * Authentication tokens


The security activity record is available immediately to everyone through the [EAS dashboard user profile settings](https://expo.dev/settings) with no additional setup required.
It is worth mentioning that, in addition to the security activity record, we also offer [Audit Logs](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024/08-21-audit-logs-available) for enterprise customers which gives deeper insights into operations on the organization level.
