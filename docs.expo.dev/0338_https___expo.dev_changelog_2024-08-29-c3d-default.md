# [Android builds are now 40% faster](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024-08-29-c3d-default)

Users who enabled this during the beta period saw their Android builds complete **40% faster on average**. Since this change is fully on EAS's infrastructure, no migrations in your project are necessary. You'll now enjoy faster Android builds at no extra cost, giving you more time to develop your app.
We are excited to announce that we've improved our Android build infrastructure, making the new infrastructure the default going forward for every EAS user.
## [Important changes ](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024-08-29-c3d-default#important-changes)
Due to the new infrastructure changes, those of you who use nested virtualization, such as an Android emulator for jobs like end-to-end tests, will need to opt out of using the new infrastructure. To use the previous infrastructure, visit your [project settings](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Baccount%5D/projects/%5Bproject%5D/settings) to switch back.
## [Wrap up ](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024-08-29-c3d-default#wrap-up)
A benefit of using EAS is that we're always trying to improve our build infrastructure to be on the latest and greatest hardware. When we roll out changes like this, you get better performance, and we're able to run more builds with less queue time.
If you have issues with the new build infrastructure or any feedback, please [contact us](https://expo.dev/contact). We value your input and are here to help.
