We are the home for developers building native apps across Android and iOS with JavaScript (neat, right?). Weâ€™re open source. Offer a free plan. And are pretty-much the go-to if youâ€™re building a mobile app.
Weâ€™re a full ecosystem of tools that help you write, build, update, submit, and monitor mobile apps. App store submission a pain? Weâ€™ve got you. Want developer tools in your app? Done. Our application services are built to help you ship faster. And if you get stuck, join our community of developers or say hello and meet our team.
Behind every movie is a production team. Behind every great chef, someone running the restaurant. Weâ€™ll take care of the slow stuff so you and your team can focus on building the worldâ€™s best apps.
## Develop
### Get started
Initialize a new project or bring an existing React Native project.
### File-based routing, TypeScript ready
Create stack and modal screens with minimal boilerplate using your filesystem. Feel confident with TypeScript.
### Get going, then keep going with fast refresh
Run your project on your own device with Expo Go. See your app update in milliseconds as you make changes.
### Use any library, SDK, or write your own native code
Youâ€™ll never be limited by Expo. Write native code. Access every device API. Write anything, then run it everywhere.
## Review
### Invite your team
With adjustable roles, your whole team can contribute, test, and view the state of your deployments.
### Upgrade your PR reviews
Commit, push to GitHub, and generate a QR code. Thatâ€™s all thatâ€™s needed to let your team review a feature before merging.
### Run end-to-end tests
Use Maestro to run automated end-to-end tests on EAS.
## Deploy
### Create and submit app store-ready builds
Kick off a build. Then weâ€™ll submit it to the App Store and Play Store automatically if you like.
### Publish bug fixes in minutes
Found a typo on your home screen? Donâ€™t sweat: fix it, then publish an update that your users will receive the next time they launch your app. 
### Dashboards to keep your team on track
We keep track of all of your builds, submissions, and deployments, organized on web dashboards for your whole team.
### Iterate with confidence
With flexible deployment patterns and the ability to rollback in seconds, you can iterate faster than ever before.

If you are planning to develop an app using react native, it's a no-brainer to go with Expo. It's like a package of goodies. I don't even understand why it's so awesome. Good job @expo team. You've made our lives simpler.

As a career-long web developer, getting push notifications working in @reactnative via @expo feels like black magic. Loving it.

It is so easy to build your own mobile app nowadays. With technologies like @reactnative and @expo, literally anyone with an idea can rapidly build their dream app. What a time to be alive!

I don't know who needs to hear this but @expo is the future.

The speed at which React Native Web via @expo has evolved in the past 6 months is absolutely wild. My head is spinning.
Trevor Hartman
@devth
Expo recently made it possible to target web, so you can write a single UI for native and web. Iâ€™m continually impressed. Otherwise next.js by @zeithq is incredible. Both of these projects have amazing docs, DX, and fast release cycles.

So @expoâ€™s over the air update feature just saved us on launch day (yes, Friday, sorry). We had a crash happening on a critical path (didnâ€™t happen in dev testing) but narrowed it down and deployed a fix using OTA in about an hour.

Itâ€™s difficult to make a tool that is powerful, easy to use, and stays out of the way. @expo has figured it out and itâ€™s one of the most pleasurable dev experiences Iâ€™ve had in my career.

I love how @expo allows me to build my standalone apps remotely on their much more powerful servers! Saves time and allows me to continue to use my computer while I wait for the build!

Arkansas Western District Court uses expo web. I chose @expo because it was the fastest way for a single developer to achieve our mandateâ€”mobile/desktop/web.
