# [Introducing Build Annotations](https://expo.dev/changelog/2023-12-01-build-annotations)
Dec 1, 2023 by

Build logs can be difficult to parse and it can be even harder to find and resolve the root cause for those errors. To make build errors easier to resolve, we're introducing a feature that adds annotations to build errors that highlight reasons and fixes for commonly seen build errors. Build Annotations can be spotted on both build and submission logs.
So if your build or submission fails, look out for the blue speech bubble in your logs in case we have any suggestions on resolving it.
