# Expo Brightness
A library that provides access to an API for getting and setting the screen brightness.
Android
iOS
Bundled version:
~13.0.3
An API to get and set screen brightness.
On Android, there is a global system-wide brightness setting, and each app has its own brightness setting that can optionally override the global setting. It is possible to set either of these values with this API. On iOS, the system brightness setting cannot be changed programmatically; instead, any changes to the screen brightness will persist until the device is locked or powered off.
## Installation
Terminal
Copy
`-Â ``npx expo install expo-brightness`
If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.
## Configuration
Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?
If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using a native android project manually, then you need to add the `android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS` permission to the AndroidManifest.xml file:
android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
Copy
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS" />

```

## Usage
Basic Brightness Usage
```
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from 'react-native';
import * as Brightness from 'expo-brightness';
export default function App() {
 useEffect(() => {
  (async () => {
   const { status } = await Brightness.requestPermissionsAsync();
   if (status === 'granted') {
    Brightness.setSystemBrightnessAsync(1);
   }
  })();
 }, []);
 return (
  <View style={styles.container}><Text>Brightness Module Example</Text></View>
 );
}
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
 container: {
  flex: 1,
  backgroundColor: '#fff',
  alignItems: 'center',
  justifyContent: 'center',
 },
});

## API
```
import * as Brightness from 'expo-brightness';

```

## Hooks
### `usePermissions(options)`
Android
iOS
Parameter| Type  
---|---  
options(optional)| `PermissionHookOptions[](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/brightness/#permissionhookoptions)<object>`  
Check or request permissions to modify the system brightness. This uses both `requestPermissionAsync` and `getPermissionsAsync` to interact with the permissions.
Returns:
`[null | PermissionResponse[](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/brightness/#permissionresponse), RequestPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse[](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/brightness/#permissionresponse)>, GetPermissionMethod<PermissionResponse[](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/brightness/#permissionresponse)>]`
Example
```
const [permissionResponse, requestPermission] = Brightness.usePermissions();

```

## Methods
### `Brightness.getBrightnessAsync()`

Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<number>`
A `Promise` that fulfils with a number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing the current screen brightness.
### `Brightness.getPermissionsAsync()`
Android
iOS
Checks user's permissions for accessing system brightness.
Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse[](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/brightness/#permissionresponse)>`
A promise that fulfils with an object of type [PermissionResponse](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/brightness/#permissionresponse).
### `Brightness.getSystemBrightnessAsync()`
Android
Gets the global system screen brightness.
Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<number>`
A `Promise` that is resolved with a number between `0` and `1`, inclusive, representing the current system screen brightness.
### `Brightness.getSystemBrightnessModeAsync()`
Android
Gets the system brightness mode (e.g. whether or not the OS will automatically adjust the screen brightness depending on ambient light).
Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<>`

Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`
Async `boolean`, indicating whether the Brightness API is available on the current device. Currently this resolves `true` on iOS and Android only.
### `Brightness.isUsingSystemBrightnessAsync()`
Android
Returns a boolean specifying whether or not the current activity is using the system-wide brightness value.
Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`
A `Promise` that fulfils with `true` when the current activity is using the system-wide brightness value, and `false` otherwise.
### `Brightness.requestPermissionsAsync()`
Android
iOS
Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing system brightness.
Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse[](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/brightness/#permissionresponse)>`
A promise that fulfils with an object of type [PermissionResponse](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/brightness/#permissionresponse).
### `Brightness.restoreSystemBrightnessAsync()`
Android
Resets the brightness setting of the current activity to use the system-wide brightness value rather than overriding it.
Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`
A `Promise` that fulfils when the setting has been successfully changed.
### `Brightness.setBrightnessAsync(brightnessValue)`
Android
iOS
Parameter| Type| Description

On Android, this setting only applies to the current activity; it will override the system brightness value whenever your app is in the foreground.
Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`
A `Promise` that fulfils when the brightness has been successfully set.
