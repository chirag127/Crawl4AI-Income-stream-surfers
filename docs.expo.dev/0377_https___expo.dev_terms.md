Last updated February 3rd, 2025
By using the expo.dev website ("Service"), or any services of 650 Industries, Inc ("Expo"), you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions ("Terms of Service"). IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND ALL USERS WHO ACCESS OUR SERVICES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS "YOU" OR "YOUR" SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND USERS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.
If Expo makes material changes to these Terms, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on our site before the changes are effective. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at: <https://expo.dev/terms>.
Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. While Expo prohibits such conduct and Content on the Service, you understand and agree that Expo cannot be responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials. You agree to use the Service at your own risk.
### [A. Account Terms](https://expo.dev/terms#a-account-terms)
  1. You must be 16 years or older to use this Service. If you are under 16 years of age, you must have explicit consent from your parent or legal guardian in order to use this Service, including consent to use elements of this Service which collect data to make delivery of this Service possible.
  2. You must be a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.
  3. You must provide your name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process.
  4. Your login may only be used by one person - a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted.
  5. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Expo cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
  6. You are responsible for all Content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when Content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).
  7. One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one free account.
  8. You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or trademark laws).


### [B. API Terms](https://expo.dev/terms#b-api-terms)
Customers may access their Expo account data via an API (Application Program Interface). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses Expo, is bound by these Terms of Service plus the following specific terms:
  1. You expressly understand and agree that Expo shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if Expo has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.
  2. Abuse or excessively frequent requests to Expo via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. Expo, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. Expo will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.
  3. Expo reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice.


### [C. Deletion, Cancellation, and Termination](https://expo.dev/terms#c-deletion-cancellation-and-termination)
  1. All of your Content will be immediately deleted from the Service upon account deletion. This information can not be recovered once your account is deleted.
  2. Accounts must be deleted by an authorized account owner by logging into the Service and using the account deletion feature. This is the sole way for a user to prove their ownership of the account. Expo cannot ascertain account ownership and delete accounts on behalf of another user via support request or any other form of communication, even if it is sent from an email address matching the email address associated with the account. Expo cannot bypass additional security measures enabled by the user to delete an account, including two-factor authentication. Users must provide the number of login factors required for the account in order prove ownership and delete the account.
  3. Upon cancellation of any paid services you may lose access to any or all related features and services. This does not affect the Content in your account.
  4. Expo, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, or any other Expo service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. Expo reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. In the event that Expo takes action to suspend or terminate an account, we will make a reasonable effort to provide the affected account owner with a copy of their account contents upon request, unless the account was suspended or terminated due to unlawful conduct.


### [D. Modifications to the Service and Prices](https://expo.dev/terms#d-modifications-to-the-service-and-prices)

You shall defend Expo against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against Expo by a third-party alleging that Your Content, or Your use of the Service in violation of this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third-party or violates applicable law, and shall indemnify Expo for any damages finally awarded against, and for reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by, Expo in connection with any such claim, demand, suit or proceeding; provided, that Expo (a) promptly gives You written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (b) gives You sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that You may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases Expo of all liability); and (c) provides to You all reasonable assistance, at Your expense.
