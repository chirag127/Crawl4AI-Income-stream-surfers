# [Project-level usage metrics](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024-12-19-project-level-usage)
Dec 19, 2024 by

Get ready to see more data about your projects: we just added resource usage data at the project level on the Expo dashboard.
Every project on expo.dev now has detailed information about how many builds you've made and how many updates you've delivered. This adds a layer of granularity to your usage data, allowing you to see the breakdown of builds and updates for each project, instead of just seeing the total for your account.
You'll see information like a breakdown of builds you and your team have made, filterable by platform and resource class. You'll also find data on your Monthly Active Users (MAU) and global edge bandwidth consumption.
To find these new usage metrics, navigate to the [usage page](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Baccount%5D/projects/%5BprojectName%5D/usage) on your project.
