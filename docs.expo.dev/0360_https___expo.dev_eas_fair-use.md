# [EAS Fair Use Policy](https://expo.dev/eas/fair-use#eas-fair-use-policy)
Last updated February 8th, 2023
Expo Application Services (EAS) are subject to this Fair Use policy.
## [Project Guidelines](https://expo.dev/eas/fair-use#project-guidelines)
We want to help you build the next great universal app. Examples of the types of projects that fall within our fair use guidelines include utility apps, food service and transportation apps, games, commerce, crypto wallets, etc.
Examples of projects and usage that are never fair use: crypto mining, scrapers, spyware, malware, and other apps that do not meet terms of service of the app stores they are intended for.
## [Usage Guidelines](https://expo.dev/eas/fair-use#usage-guidelines)
Our goal is to make building apps as accessible as possible; the below guidelines ensure we're able to do just that.
Using services outside their intended purpose is not allowed. Examples of inappropriate usage include using EAS for web hosting, sending emails, crypto mining, etc.
### [Typical Usage](https://expo.dev/eas/fair-use#typical-usage)
For folks whose usage is much greater than what is typical for your plan, we may be required to limit usage to prevent unreasonable burden on our infrastructure. If you think you will need more resources than is typical, please reach out to us on our [contact page](https://expo.dev/contact).
### [Commercial Usage](https://expo.dev/eas/fair-use#commercial-usage)
Free accounts are restricted to pre-revenue startups, proof of concepts, and hobby and student projects. All commercial projects with >$1,500 USD in monthly revenue are required to be on a paid plan.
Examples of commercial use include, but are not limited to, apps that
  * Request and process payment
  * Advertise a product or service
  * Are affiliate marketing-based


Asking for donations is not considered commercial use.
Free accounts may be used for commercial purposes if no paid services are used (e.g., the account is used only in the course of running builds outside of EAS infrastructure).
If you're not sure whether your project would be defined as commercial usage, please [contact us](https://expo.dev/contact).
For further information about this policy and the use of our services, please see our [Terms of Service](https://expo.dev/terms).
