# Next steps
Develop, review, and submit your project.
Here are next steps to continue building your app:
### Reset your project
You can remove the boilerplate code and start fresh with a new project. Run the following command to reset your project:
Terminal
Copy
`-Â ``npm run reset-project`
This command will move the existing files in app to app-example, then create a new app directory with a new index.tsx file.
### Develop, review, and deploy
Learn how to develop by reading the docs in the Develop section. You'll learn how to create [UI elements](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/splash-screen-and-app-icon), add [unit tests](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/unit-testing), include [native modules](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction), and more.
Once you've developed your app, you can share it with your teammates for [review](https://docs.expo.dev/review/overview).
Finally, you can [build](https://docs.expo.dev/deploy/build-project) and [submit](https://docs.expo.dev/deploy/submit-to-app-stores) your project to the app stores.
