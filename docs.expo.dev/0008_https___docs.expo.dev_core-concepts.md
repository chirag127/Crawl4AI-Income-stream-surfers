# Core concepts
An overview of Expo tools, features and services.
Expo is an [open-source framework](https://github.com/expo/expo/) for apps that run natively on Android, iOS, and the web. Expo brings together the best of mobile and the web and enables many important features for building and scaling an app.
The `expo` npm package enables a suite of incredible features for React Native apps. The `expo` package can be installed in nearly any React Native project.
## Tools and features

> All features are free, optional, and can be used independently of each other. Unused features add no additional bloat to your app.

## Services
The team behind Expo also provides Expo Application Services (EAS), deeply integrated cloud services for building, submitting, and updating your React Native app. EAS can be used with any React Native app, regardless of whether it uses `expo` or not.
