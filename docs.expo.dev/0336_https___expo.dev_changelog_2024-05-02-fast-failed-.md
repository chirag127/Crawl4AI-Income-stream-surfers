# [EAS Build: Pricing update](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024-05-02-fast-failed-builds-exclusion)
May 2, 2024 by

EAS Build is used by thousands of developers to build their apps on a daily basis. Some of these developers experience friction when they try to build a project via EAS Build, only for it to fail quickly for a variety of reasons, such as invalid configurations or minor code errors. This can be a frustrating experience, and doubly so when these failed builds cost developers money.
In an effort to continuously improve the Expo developer experience, we're happy to announce that from May 1, 2024, these builds will no longer be billed for or count against your monthly quota if you are on a Free plan. We define a "fast-failed build" as one that fails within 3 minutes. Each account will get a maximum of 10 of these waived each month.
