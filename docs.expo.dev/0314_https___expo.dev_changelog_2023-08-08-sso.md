# [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://expo.dev/changelog/2023-08-08-sso)
Aug 8, 2023 by
Will Schurman
For many organizations, having third-party tool access be federated by a single identity management system is a requirement.
Starting today, EAS Enterprise customers who use [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) as their workforce Identity Provider can take advantage of a more seamless authentication experience for employee sign-in on EAS.
Support for additional Identity Providers is coming soon.
## [Getting started for enterprise customers ](https://expo.dev/changelog/2023-08-08-sso#getting-started-for-enterprise-customers)
SSO is available for [Enterprise Plan customers](https://expo.dev/pricing). To get started, [contact us](https://expo.dev/contact) so that we can help you set it up for your organization and see [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://docs.expo.dev/accounts/sso/) documentation.
If you use an identity provider other than Okta and wish to use SSO, [contact us](https://expo.dev/contact) and provide us with the name of your provider, and we'll get back to you about when support can be expected.
