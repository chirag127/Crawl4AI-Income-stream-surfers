# [EAS Update: new dashboard UI features](https://expo.dev/changelog/2023-12-13-eas-update-ui)
Dec 13, 2023 by

We want to make the [EAS](https://expo.dev/eas) Dashboard as useful as possible and important step in that direction is to create feature parity with the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/) wherever possible.
Recently we released some updates to the dashboard that allow you to:
  * create new channels
  * remove them
  * republish updates
  * remove them as well


These additions to the dashboard will make it simpler and more convenient to manage projects because you no longer need to to switch to the CLI for some workflows.
You can try them by visiting Channels and Updates pages in your project.
