# [Link your GitHub repo with Expo](https://expo.dev/changelog/2023-07-19-github-linking)
Jul 19, 2023 by

To make building your project even faster, we now support linking your GitHub repo with your Expo project on expo.dev. This allows you to:
  * Kick off a build from [expo.dev](http://expo.dev/). This allows anyone on your team to kick off a build quickly, without needed to jump into the command line.
  * Kick off a build from a PR using a label. For example, adding a label named `eas-build-android:production` will kick off an Android build on the production build profile using the latest code on the current branch.


EAS customers can get started by going to [your project's GitHub settings](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Baccount%5D/projects/%5Bproject%5D/github) and linking your GitHub account.
