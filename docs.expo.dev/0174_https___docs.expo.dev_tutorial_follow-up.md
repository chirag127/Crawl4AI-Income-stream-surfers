# Learning resources
Explore a curated list of resources to learn about Expo and React Native.
Now that the example app is done, let's learn more about the technologies we used to build it.
## Build your project into an app
To start creating a new app, you can either:
  * [Get started at expo.new](https://expo.new/) which automatically configures a project with file-based routing and the required setup for EAS Build and EAS Update.
  * Or, start locally on your machine and use `npx create-expo-app@latest` and [set up your development environment](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment) sequentially.


### Recommended resources
Once you've created your new project, you can learn more about different tools and concepts that will help you on your app development journey:
  * [Development tools](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/tools): A reference of Expo tools that will help you during various aspects of your app-building journey.
  * [Development builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction): Using a development build allows you to gain full control over your app's build process, and to test your app on a device or simulator.
  * [Development overview](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/overview): This is a high-level overview that provides details on key concepts for developing an app with Expo and the flow of core development loop.
  * [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction): We went through basics of Expo Router and implemented a tab navigator. See its documentation to learn more about the library.
  * [App icon](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/splash-screen-and-app-icon#app-icon) and [splash screen](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/splash-screen-and-app-icon#splash-screen): You can learn more about customizing your app icon and splash screen guides. Also, look through the [app config reference](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration) for properties you can configure in the app.json file.
  * [App distribution](https://docs.expo.dev/deploy/build-project) and [submission](https://docs.expo.dev/deploy/submit-to-app-stores) to app stores: Read these resources to learn more about how to release and submit your app to app stores once it's ready to ship.
  * [Debugging](https://docs.expo.dev/debugging/runtime-issues): Sometimes things go wrong, and when they do, you can use debugging tools to find and fix errors.


## Learning
### React
We used React components and APIs. Having a solid understanding of React is essential to using Expo to build your app. We recommend reading the React documentation's [Quick Start section](https://react.dev/learn) and the [Hooks section](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks).
### React Native
While developing the tutorial app, we used React Native extensively. You can start from the [React Native basics guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) to learn more. Also, check out the following docs:
  * [View API reference](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view)
  * [Text API reference](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text)
  * [Platform specific code](https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code)
  * [Presenting data in a list](https://reactnative.dev/docs/using-a-listview)


We used Flexbox to layout our components. Check out the following recommendations to learn more about it:
  * [Layout with Flexbox](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox)


### Gestures and animations
To learn more about implementing different types of gestures and animations, we recommend the following documentation:
  * [React Native Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/)
  * [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started)
