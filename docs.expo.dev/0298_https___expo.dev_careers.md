# [We're creating the way people write and distribute application software.](https://expo.dev/careers#were-creating-the-way-people-write-and-distribute-application-software)
## [Our values](https://expo.dev/careers#our-values)
  * **Build developer trust** : Be dependable and help developers find success.
  * **Autonomy** : Take an idea, sketch it, build it, release it, and maintain it.
  * **Flexible primitives** : Start with powerful building blocks that accommodate a high level of control for developers who need it.
  * **Fast-forward principle** : Build accelerated paths on top of flexible primitives to fast-forward developers when they don't need extra complexity.
  * **Make it work, make it right, make it fast** : Release good software, then follow up with fixes that make it great software.


## [What we're working on right now](https://expo.dev/careers#what-were-working-on-right-now)
  * We're uniting the web and native apps by allowing developers to write universal and platform-specific code in one code base. This means writing libraries like the Expo Modules API for Android, iOS, web, and other platforms, or working on the development tools that enable file-based routing and React Server Components to work on web and mobile apps alike.
  * We're also working on Expo Application Services (EAS). Currently, we're interested in creating continuous deployment workflows that allow teams to test and ship changes faster. This means working on website dashboards, a suite of services like EAS Build, and account and billing management.


## [Perks](https://expo.dev/careers#perks)
  * Competitive compensation (salary, equity)
  * Healthcare benefits (U.S. only)
  * 401(k) retirement plan (U.S. only)
  * $6,000 equipment budget for computers, phones, other equipment you need to be most productive
  * Flexible schedule
  * Unlimited vacation (current employees average 17 days excluding holidays per year)
  * 12 week parental leave
  * Continuous learning budget
  * Conference speaking opportunities
  * Regional meetups
