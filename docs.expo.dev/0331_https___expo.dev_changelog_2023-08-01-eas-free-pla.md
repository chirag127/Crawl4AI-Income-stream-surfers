# [Enforcement of EAS Free plan limits](https://expo.dev/changelog/2023-08-01-eas-free-plan-limits)
Aug 1, 2023 by
Chris Jensen
Starting August 1, 2023, [the limits of our Free plan](https://expo.dev/pricing) will be enforced regarding EAS Build and EAS Update.
Currently, our free users enjoy 30 free, lower-priority builds with EAS Build, up to 15 of which can be for iOS. Additionally, for EAS Update, you can send updates to 1,000 active users and 100 GiB of global edge bandwidth. These limits reset every calendar month.
We encourage you to sign up for [account notifications](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Baccount%5D/settings/email-notifications), which will keep you informed about your usage nearing these limits.
[Upgrade your plan](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Baccount%5D/settings/billing) to do more builds with shorter wait times and increased concurrencies and to send updates to more than 1,000 active users.
