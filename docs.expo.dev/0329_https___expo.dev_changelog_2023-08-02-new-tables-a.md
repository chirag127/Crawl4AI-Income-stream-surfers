# [New Dashboard Tables and More Timeline Activities](https://expo.dev/changelog/2023-08-02-new-tables-and-timeline-activities)

We refreshed a big chunk of our dashboard â€“ by replacing all tables. They have better visual information density, a fresh new look, and many of them had their backend endpoints rewritten to be much faster to load.
Additionally, we added more activities to the timeline. You can now see your updates and submissions there. It paints a much better picture of what's happening in your projects and organizations!
