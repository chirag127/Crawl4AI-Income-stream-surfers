# Expo StoreReview
A library that provides access to native APIs for in-app reviews.
Android
iOS
Bundled version:
~8.0.1
`expo-store-review` is a library that provides access to `ReviewManager` API on Android 5+ and `SKStoreReviewController` API on iOS. It allows you to ask the user to rate your app without leaving the app itself.
## Installation
Terminal
Copy
`-Â ``npx expo install expo-store-review`
If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.
## Usage
It is important that you follow the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ratings-and-reviews) for iOS and [Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review#when-to-request) for Android when using this API.
Specifically:
  * Don't call `StoreReview.requestReview()` from a button - instead try calling it after the user has finished some signature interaction in the app.
  * Don't spam the user.
  * Don't request a review when the user is doing something time sensitive like navigating.
  * Don't ask the user any questions before or while presenting the rating button or card.


### Write reviews
#### Android
There is no equivalent redirect on Android, you can still open the Play Store to the reviews sections using the query parameter `showAllReviews=true` like this:
Android Play Store example
Copy
```
const androidPackageName = 'host.exp.exponent';
// Open the Android Play Store in the browser -> redirects to Play Store on Android
Linking.openURL(
 `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=${androidPackageName}&showAllReviews=true`
);
// Open the Android Play Store directly
Linking.openURL(`market://details?id=${androidPackageName}&showAllReviews=true`);

```

#### iOS
You can redirect an app user to the "Write a Review" screen for an app in the iOS App Store by using the query parameter `action=write-review`. For example:
iOS App Store example
Copy
```
const itunesItemId = 982107779;
// Open the iOS App Store in the browser -> redirects to App Store on iOS
Linking.openURL(`https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id${itunesItemId}?action=write-review`);
// Open the iOS App Store directly
Linking.openURL(
 `itms-apps://itunes.apple.com/app/viewContentsUserReviews/id${itunesItemId}?action=write-review`
);

```

## API
```
import * as StoreReview from 'expo-store-review';

```

## Methods
### `StoreReview.hasAction()`
Android
iOS
Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`
This returns a promise that fulfills to `true` if `StoreReview.requestReview()` is capable directing the user to some kind of store review flow. If the app config (`app.json`) does not contain store URLs and native store review capabilities are not available then the promise will fulfill to `false`.
Example
```
if (await StoreReview.hasAction()) {
 // you can call StoreReview.requestReview()
}

```

### `StoreReview.isAvailableAsync()`
Android
iOS
Determines if the platform has the capabilities to use `StoreReview.requestReview()`.
Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`
This returns a promise fulfills with `boolean`, depending on the platform:
  * On iOS, it will resolve to `true` unless the app is distributed through TestFlight.
  * On Android, it will resolve to `true` if the device is running Android 5.0+.
  * On Web, it will resolve to `false`.


### `StoreReview.requestReview()`
Android
iOS
In ideal circumstances this will open a native modal and allow the user to select a star rating that will then be applied to the App Store, without leaving the app. If the device is running a version of Android lower than 5.0, this will attempt to get the store URL and link the user to it.
Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`
### `StoreReview.storeUrl()`
Android
iOS
This uses the `Constants` API to get the `Constants.expoConfig.ios.appStoreUrl` on iOS, or the `Constants.expoConfig.android.playStoreUrl` on Android.
On Web this will return `null`.
Returns:
`string | null`
## Error codes
### `ERR_STORE_REVIEW_FAILED`
This error occurs when the store review request was not successful.
