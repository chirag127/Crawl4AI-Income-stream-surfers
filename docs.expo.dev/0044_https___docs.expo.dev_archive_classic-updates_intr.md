# Classic Updates
Classic Updates was a service by Expo that delivered updates to end-users using Expo CLI's `expo publish` command. It was supported by Expo through August 2022, when it was replaced by [EAS Update](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update).
Classic Updates will be sunset gradually throughout 2023 and 2024. If your project is using Classic Updates actively, migrate to [EAS Update](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/migrate-from-classic-updates).
