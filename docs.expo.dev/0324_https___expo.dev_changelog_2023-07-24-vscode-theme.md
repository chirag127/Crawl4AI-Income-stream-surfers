# [Expo VS Code theme](https://expo.dev/changelog/2023-07-24-vscode-theme)
Jul 24, 2023 by

When we updated our [docs](https://docs.expo.dev/) with a new design, we also updated our code theme. We heard that people loved the new theme and wanted to use it in their own editors. So, we're happy to announce that we've released the theme for VS Code!
You can code in style with Expo's theme by installing it from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=expo.vscode-expo-theme).
