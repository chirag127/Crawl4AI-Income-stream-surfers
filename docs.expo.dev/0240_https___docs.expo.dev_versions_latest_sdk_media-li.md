# Expo MediaLibrary
A library that provides access to the device's media library.
Android
iOS
Bundled version:
~17.0.6
`expo-media-library` provides access to the user's media library, allowing them to access their existing images and videos from your app, as well as save new ones. You can also subscribe to any updates made to the user's media library.
> Android allows full access to the media library (which is the purpose of this package) only for applications needing broad access to photos. See [Details on Google Play's Photo and Video Permissions policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/14115180).
## Installation
Terminal
Copy
`-Â ``npx expo install expo-media-library`
If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project.
## Configuration in app config
You can configure `expo-media-library` using its built-in [config plugin](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/introduction) if you use config plugins in your project ([EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction) or `npx expo run:[android|ios]`). The plugin allows you to configure various properties that cannot be set at runtime and require building a new app binary to take effect.
### Example app.json with config plugin
```
{
 "expo": {
  "plugins": [
   [
    "expo-media-library",
    {
     "photosPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your photos.",
     "savePhotosPermission": "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to save photos.",
     "isAccessMediaLocationEnabled": true
    }
   ]
  ]
 }
}

```

### Configurable properties
Name| Default| Description  
---|---|---  
`photosPermission`| `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your photos."`| Only for: iOSSets the iOS `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` permission message in Info.plist.  
`savePhotosPermission`| `"Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to save photos."`| Only for: iOSSets the iOS `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` permission message in Info.plist.  
`isAccessMediaLocationEnabled`| `false`| Only for: AndroidSets whether or not to request the `ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION` permission on Android.  
Are you using this library in an existing React Native app?
If you're not using Continuous Native Generation ([CNG](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation)) or you're using native android ios projects manually, then you need to add following permissions and configuration to your native projects:
Android
  * To access asset location (latitude and longitude EXIF tags), add `ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION` permission to your project's android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION" />

```

  * [Scoped storage](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage#scoped-storage) is available from Android 10. To make `expo-media-library` work with scoped storage, you need to add the following configuration to your android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:
```
<manifest ... >
 <application android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true" ...>
</manifest>

```



iOS
  * Add `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`, and `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` keys to your project's ios/[app]/Info.plist:
```
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to access your photos</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to save photos</string>

```



## Usage
Fetching albums and displaying assets
```
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Button, Text, SafeAreaView, ScrollView, StyleSheet, Image, View, Platform } from 'react-native';
import * as MediaLibrary from 'expo-media-library';
export default function App() {
 const [albums, setAlbums] = useState(null);
 const [permissionResponse, requestPermission] = MediaLibrary.usePermissions();
 async function getAlbums() {
  if (permissionResponse.status !== 'granted') {
   await requestPermission();
  }
  const fetchedAlbums = await MediaLibrary.getAlbumsAsync({
   includeSmartAlbums: true,
  });
  setAlbums(fetchedAlbums);
 }
 return (
  <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}><Button onPress={getAlbums} title="Get albums" /><ScrollView>{albums && albums.map((album) => <AlbumEntry album={album} />)}</ScrollView></SafeAreaView>
 );
}
function AlbumEntry({ album }) {
 const [assets, setAssets] = useState([]);
 useEffect(() => {
  async function getAlbumAssets() {
   const albumAssets = await MediaLibrary.getAssetsAsync({ album });
   setAssets(albumAssets.assets);
  }
  getAlbumAssets();
 }, [album]);
 return (
  <View key={album.id} style={styles.albumContainer}><Text>{album.title} - {album.assetCount ?? 'no'} assets
   </Text><View style={styles.albumAssetsContainer}>{assets && assets.map((asset) => (
     <Image source={{ uri: asset.uri }} width={50} height={50} />
    ))}</View></View>
 );

### `MediaLibrary.migrateAlbumIfNeededAsync(album)`
Android
iOS
Parameter| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
album| | An [Album](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/media-library/#album) or its ID.  
Moves album content to the special media directories on Android R or above if needed. Those new locations are in line with the Android `scoped storage` - so your application won't lose write permission to those directories in the future.
This method does nothing if:
  * app is running on iOS, web or Android below R
  * app has write permission to the album folder


The migration is possible when the album contains only compatible files types. For instance, movies and pictures are compatible with each other, but music and pictures are not. If automatic migration isn't possible, the function rejects. In that case, you can use methods from the `expo-file-system` to migrate all your files manually.
#### Why do you need to migrate files?
Android R introduced a lot of changes in the storage system. Now applications can't save anything to the root directory. The only available locations are from the `MediaStore` API. Unfortunately, the media library stored albums in folders for which, because of those changes, the application doesn't have permissions anymore. However, it doesn't mean you need to migrate all your albums. If your application doesn't add assets to albums, you don't have to migrate. Everything will work as it used to. You can read more about scoped storage in [the Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage).
Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`
A promise which fulfils to `void`.
### `MediaLibrary.presentPermissionsPickerAsync(mediaTypes)`
Android 14+
iOS
Parameter| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
mediaTypes(optional)| `MediaTypeFilter[][](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/media-library/#mediatypefilter)`| Limits the type(s) of media that the user will be granting access to. By default, a list that shows both photos and videos is presented.  
Allows the user to update the assets that your app has access to. The system modal is only displayed if the user originally allowed only `limited` access to their media library, otherwise this method is a no-op.
Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`
A promise that either rejects if the method is unavailable, or resolves to `void`.
> Note: This method doesn't inform you if the user changes which assets your app has access to. That information is only exposed by iOS, and to obtain it, you need to subscribe for updates to the user's media library using [`addListener()`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/media-library/#medialibraryaddlistenerlistener). If `hasIncrementalChanges` is `false`, the user changed their permissions.
### `MediaLibrary.removeAssetsFromAlbumAsync(assets, album)`
Android
iOS
Parameter| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
assets| ``| An array of [Asset](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/media-library/#asset) or their IDs.  
album| | An [Album](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/media-library/#album) or its ID.

On Android, album will be automatically deleted if there are no more assets inside.
Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<boolean>`
Returns promise which fulfils with `true` if the assets were successfully removed from the album.
### `MediaLibrary.removeSubscription(subscription)`
Android
iOS
Parameter| Type  
---|---  
subscription| `EventSubscription`  
Returns:
`void`
### `MediaLibrary.requestPermissionsAsync(writeOnly, granularPermissions)`
Android
iOS
Parameter| Type| Description  
---|---|---  
writeOnly(optional)| `boolean`  
granularPermissions(optional)| `GranularPermission[][](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/media-library/#granularpermission)`| A list of [`GranularPermission`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/media-library/#granularpermission) values. This parameter has an effect only on Android 13 and newer. By default, `expo-media-library` will ask for all possible permissions.  
Asks the user to grant permissions for accessing media in user's media library.
Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<PermissionResponse[](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/media-library/#permissionresponse)>`

Unlike [`createAssetAsync()`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/media-library/#medialibrarycreateassetasynclocaluri), This method doesn't return created asset. On iOS 11+, it's possible to use this method without asking for `CAMERA_ROLL` permission, however then yours `Info.plist` should have `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` key.
Returns:
`Promise[](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)<void>`

On Android it's invoked with an empty object. On iOS, it's invoked with [`MediaLibraryAssetsChangeEvent`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/media-library/#medialibraryassetschangeevent) object. Additionally, only on iOS, the listener is also invoked when the user changes access to individual assets in the media library using `presentPermissionsPickerAsync()`.  
Subscribes for updates in user's media library.
Returns:
`EventSubscription`
An [`Subscription`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/media-library/#subscription) object that you can call `remove()` on when you would like to unsubscribe the listener.
