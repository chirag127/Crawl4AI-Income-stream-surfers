# Introduction
Get started creating apps with Expo.
Expo is a framework that makes developing Android and iOS apps easier. Our framework provides file-based routing, a standard library of native modules, and much more. Expo is open source with an active community on [GitHub](https://github.com/expo/expo) and [Discord](https://chat.expo.dev).
We also make [Expo Application Services (EAS)](https://expo.dev/eas), a set of services that complement the Expo framework in each step of the development process.
There are two ways to get started:
[Automated setup with expo.newCreate a project, set up your development environment, automatically configure build and update automations, and start developing.](https://expo.new/) [Quick start docsCreate a project, set up your development environment, and start developing.](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project)
