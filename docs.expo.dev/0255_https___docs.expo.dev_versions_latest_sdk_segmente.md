# SegmentedControl
A React Native library that provides a component to render UISegmentedControl from iOS.
Android
iOS
Web
Bundled version:
2.5.4
It's like a fancy radio button, or in Apple's words: "A horizontal control that consists of multiple segments, each segment functioning as a discrete button" ([source](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisegmentedcontrol)). This component renders to a [`UISegmentedControl`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisegmentedcontrol) on iOS, and to faithful recreations of that control on Android and web (because no equivalent exists on those platforms' standard libraries).
## Installation
Terminal
Copy
`-Â ``npx expo install @react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control`
If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project. Then, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control#getting-started) provided in the library's README or documentation.
