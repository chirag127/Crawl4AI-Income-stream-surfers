# [Privacy Policy Updated: DPF Replaces Privacy Shield](https://expo.dev/changelog/2024-12-17-dpf-replaces-privacy-shield)
Dec 17, 2024 by

We recently updated our [privacy policy](https://expo.dev/privacy) to reflect changes in data protection laws and our adherence to them.
Since the replacement of Privacy Shield in 2020, Expo has complied with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States.
At the time, we self-certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles; however, the privacy policy hosted on our website has only now been updated accordingly. We regret the oversight, and our privacy policy now reflects our compliance with these Data Privacy frameworks.
You can read the updated privacy policy [here](https://expo.dev/privacy).
