# Screens
A library that provides native primitives to represent screens instead of plain React Native View components for better operating system behavior and screen optimizations.
Android
iOS
tvOS
Web
Bundled version:
~4.4.0
`react-native-screens` provides native primitives to represent screens instead of plain `<View>` components To better take advantage of operating system behavior and optimizations around screens. This capability is used by library authors and is unlikely to be used directly by most app developers. It also provides the native components needed for React Navigation's [`createNativeStackNavigator`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator).
> Note: See [`react-native-screens` issue tracker](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens/issues) if you encounter any problems.
## Installation
Terminal
Copy
`-Â ``npx expo install react-native-screens`
If you are installing this in an [existing React Native app](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/overview), make sure to [install `expo`](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules) in your project. Then, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens#installation) provided in the library's README or documentation.
## API
The complete API reference and documentation are available in the [`react-native-screens` README](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens).
To use the native stack navigator if you are using React Navigation, see [`createNativeStackNavigator` documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/native-stack-navigator).
